Installing RaspAP
Follow steps exactly as described here (tested)
  https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/RPi-Zero-W-AP-STA-mode
  Most importantly - DO NOT REBOOT before configuring the hotsopot via web interface
    I mistakenly/ignorently rebooted and then there is no easy way to fix this, without 
    starting from fresh raspbian installation.
    
  

Current version of RaspAP ships with beta version of ad blocker.

For using AdaGuard refer (not tested)
  
  
Or with PiHole (not tested):

  Finally, got it working.

      Install RaspAP
      Install Pi-Hole
      sudo touch /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
      sudo chown pihole:pihole /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
      reboot
