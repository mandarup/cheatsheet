Installing RaspAP
Follow steps exactly as described here (tested)
  https://github.com/billz/raspap-webgui/wiki/RPi-Zero-W-AP-STA-mode
  Most importantly - DO NOT REBOOT before configuring the hotsopot via web interface
    I mistakenly/ignorently rebooted and then there is no easy way to fix this, without 
    starting from fresh raspbian installation.
    
- if for some reason virtual uap0 interface disappears, manually run these commands as described in above link
    $ iw dev wlan0 interface add uap0 type __ap
    $ ifconfig uap0 up
    # now this should be visible on
    $ ifconfig

Current version of RaspAP ships with beta version of ad blocker.

For using AdaGuard refer (not tested)
  
  
Or with PiHole (not tested):

  Finally, got it working.

      Install RaspAP
      Install Pi-Hole
      sudo touch /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
      sudo chown pihole:pihole /var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases
      reboot
